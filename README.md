**Using Vnna python library to convert text-to-sql queries**
Installed vanna in my local in separate python environment so that it will not mess up with core python libraries used by OS.
To enable the specific vanna environment using this command in ubuntu - **source vanna-env/bin/activate**
To deactivate the environment, ubuntu command is -  **deactivate**
